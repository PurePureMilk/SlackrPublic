App Description: We will create a social networking application allowing
students to connect with other students to be study partners, tutors,
peer mentors, or form a study group. The goal of this application is to
build a sense of community of people in college and overcoming the
barriers of social distancing. The main feature of this application is
its matchmaking feature such as the stack of cards used in popular
matchmaking apps. This feature is used to ease the choice anxiety of
users when faced with a list of people to contact. Not only that,
helping the user focus on just one card on the stack can help the person
understand the person what to get to know better. From there, the user
can weed out certain people they are not interested in this organized
fashion. How users get to know each other is by making profiles. Users
are required to make an account and have the necessary valid
information.
